# Copilot Demo

To play demo:

- Checkout *start* tag
- Go at the end of *sync.go* file
- Type following comment: `// SyncedString is synchronized string`
- Type TAB until Copilot has written `SyncedString` structure, `Get` and `Set` functions
- Type following comment: `// Append string`

Code for SyncedString was done in a minute. Let's add tests:

- Create file *sync_test.go*
- Write code `package main`
- Type TAB until Copilot has written `TestSyncedBool` and `TestSyncedString`

You can see expected result checking out tag *end* and discuss.
